# Redline AI Word Add-in

AI-assisted contract review for Microsoft Word. The task pane reads the selected clause, sends it to a secure backend, and applies tracked changes plus comments.

## What’s included
- `manifest.xml` for sideloading the add-in
- Task pane UI in `src/taskpane/`
- Backend proxy in `server/` that calls OpenAI or Azure OpenAI

## Backend setup

```bash
npm install
npm run start:server
```

Environment variables:

```bash
# OpenAI (default)
export AI_PROVIDER=openai
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key
export OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o

# Or Azure OpenAI
export AI_PROVIDER=azure
export AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource.openai.azure.com
export AZURE_OPENAI_KEY=your_key
export AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT=your_deployment
export AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=2024-06-01
```

The server listens on `http://localhost:8787` by default. The task pane expects a full URL (for example, `http://localhost:8787/api/review`).

Tip: start from `.env.example` if you prefer loading env vars from a file.

## Example files for ignored items

The repo intentionally ignores secrets and runtime artifacts. These examples are included to show the expected shape:

- `.env.example` → copy to `.env` for local env vars
- `certs/README.md`, `certs/dev.crt.example`, `certs/dev.key.example` → local HTTPS cert placeholders
- `logs/example.log`, `logs/README.md` → log file examples
- `examples/node_modules.txt` → `node_modules/` is generated by `npm install`

## Task pane hosting

Office add-ins require HTTPS for the task pane UI. You can host `src/` with any HTTPS static server and point the manifest to it. For local development, generate a local certificate and serve `src/` at `https://localhost:3000` (see `certs/README.md`).

## Add-in sideloading

1. Update the manifest URLs if your host differs from `https://localhost:3000`.
2. Sideload `manifest.xml` in Word (Insert > Add-ins > Upload My Add-in).
3. Open the “Redline AI” tab and launch the task pane.

## Security notes
- Do not embed API keys in the task pane code.
- Use the backend proxy or enterprise auth for production use.
